/**
 * RuntimeScriptInjector — runs the site's bundled runtime scripts inside an
 * editable canvas iframe.
 *
 * The canvas frames are same-origin, React-rendered iframes (see
 * `IframeFrameSurface`). To make authored behaviour run in-place without
 * leaving the editor, we append the bundled entry scripts (from
 * `useRuntimeScriptBuild`) as inline `<script type="module">` elements into
 * the iframe document. Module scripts appended after load execute against the
 * already-rendered DOM — exactly what we want, since React mounted the node
 * tree first.
 *
 * Why imperative DOM, not JSX:
 * Browsers do not execute `<script>` elements that React inserts as part of
 * its tree, so we create the elements with `document.createElement('script')`
 * and `appendChild` them — that path does run them. Head-placed scripts go in
 * `<head>`, everything else at `<body>` end (publisher placement parity).
 *
 * Re-run semantics:
 * The effect depends on the `scripts` array. `useRuntimeScriptBuild` returns a
 * stable array reference between builds (and a stable empty sentinel while
 * idle/building), so this effect re-runs exactly when a new build lands —
 * which only happens on a script edit, a dependency change, or an explicit
 * Refresh, never on an ordinary node-tree edit. When it does re-run, the old
 * `<script>` elements are removed and the new ones appended, re-executing the
 * scripts. Removing a `<script>` element does not undo side effects it already
 * caused (listeners, injected nodes) — re-running is the "refresh", which is
 * why the toggle UI surfaces a manual Refresh too.
