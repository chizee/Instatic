# Production Docker Image

The production image is the portable Instatic artifact. It contains the built admin UI, the Bun server, the public renderer, CMS API routes, migrations, and runtime dependencies.

## Build Locally

```sh
docker build -t instatic-cms:local .
```

The image does not run Vite or install dependencies at container startup. Those happen at image build time.

## Pull A Published Image

Once releases publish images, production servers should pull the image instead of building from source:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/GITHUB_OWNER/IMAGE_NAME:latest
```

Pin a version for predictable upgrades:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/GITHUB_OWNER/IMAGE_NAME:1.0.0
```

`GITHUB_OWNER` and `IMAGE_NAME` are placeholders until the public repository/package name is finalized.

## Run With An External Postgres Database

Use this mode when you already operate Postgres separately (your own server, a managed Postgres provider, etc.).

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name instatic-cms \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@host:5432/instatic" \
  -e STATIC_DIR=/app/dist \
  -e UPLOADS_DIR=/app/uploads \
  -v instatic-uploads:/app/uploads \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/GITHUB_OWNER/IMAGE_NAME:latest
```

Then open:

```txt
http://localhost:3001/admin
```

## Required Runtime Variables

- `DATABASE_URL`: Postgres or SQLite connection string (e.g. `postgres://...` or `sqlite:/app/data/cms.db`).
- `STATIC_DIR`: built asset directory. Use `/app/dist` in the Docker image.
- `UPLOADS_DIR`: upload directory. Use `/app/uploads` in the Docker image.
- `PORT`: optional. Defaults to `3001`; some hosting providers inject this automatically.

## Health Check

```sh
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{"status":"ok","ts":1234567890}
```
